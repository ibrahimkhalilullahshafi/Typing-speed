                        <strong>Answer: </strong><br>
                        The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or
                        local
                        storage. It allows, for example, the addition, modification, or deletion of stored data items.
                        LocalStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same. Both have the following rules:<br>
                        They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.<br>
                        The values stored may only be strings.<br>
                        They have a limit of around 5MB ofstorage space.<br>
                        The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.<br>
                        LocalStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a
                        new tab,
                        or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.<br>
                        Session storage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab
                        or the
                        browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session
                        and new
                        storage.

                        <strong>Answer: </strong><br>
                        <strong>The Global scope</strong><br>
                        A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or
                        curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any
                        line of code in the program, including inside blocks.<br>
                        <strong>The Block scope</strong><br>
                        So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in
                        the global or local scope. The variables
                        that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within
                        the block that they are defined.

                        Q:3: How event loop works in javascript?

                <div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse"

                        <strong>Answer: </strong><br>
                        The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                        operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion
                        of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at
                        what happens on the back-end.<br>
                        The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.
                        Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.<br>
                        The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows
                        the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent
                        for execution.<br>
                        Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the
                        browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own
                        single-threaded operation.<br>
                        An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the
                        stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this
                        operation back in for processing.<br>
                        Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running
                        async operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act
                        as separate threads.<br>
                        The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is
                        empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the
                        current function call is processed.

                        <strong>Answer: </strong><br>
                        The undefined is a primitive type that has a single value undefined.<br>
                        Accessing an uninitialized variable returns undefined.<br>
                        Accessing a non-existing property of an object returns undefined.<br>
                        Accessing a out-of-bounds array element returns undefined.<br>
                        A function without a return statement or with a return statement but without an expression
                        returns undefined.
